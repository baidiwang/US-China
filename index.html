          In 1949, after winning the war against the Nationalist, Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong established the People’s Republic of China. The U.S., as a supporter of the Nationalist government, hadn’t established diplomatic
          relations
          with China in several decades since then. In 1950, the Korean War broke out. China sent troops to North Korea to help fight with U.S. and South Korea when their troops approached the Chinese border. Until 1979, the U.S. President
          Richard
          Nixon visited China, improving the relations from a frozen status to a gradually normal status, but the two countries still made slow progress in the relations because other issues and events including Tiananmen Square Massacre in
          1989.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph" id="2000_2016">
          In 2000, the relations got warmed up because the U.S. allowed China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001. The normalization of trade relations meant significantly to China, as joining the WTO marked China’s economy headed
          into a
          new
          era of rapid development. Since then, China had kept growing fast in economy and military. In 2008, China became the largest holder of U.S. debt. Two years later, China became the world’s second-largest economy.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          While the world was watching how fast China grew in the last two decades, the U.S. felt the threat from China. In 2011, the U.S. announced its “pivot” to Asia, especially to China. In 2012, the U.S. and its allies contend China
          about
          China’s violation towards international trade norm. In the same year, Xi Jinping became the new president of China, who has centralized his power since then.</p>

        <p class="paragraph" id="2017_2018">
          In 2017, President Trump started his presidential era, leading the relations to a more oppositive and sensitive stage. However, the formerly normal, or even good relationship has changed to the current tension, especially in the
          wake of
          President Trump’s trade war and the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
        </p>

        <p>
          In such a complicated situation, where is the U.S.-China relationship heading?

          The two countries’ relationship started deteriorating after Trump won the 2016 election as he underlined trade practices that he called unfair. In 2018, with the start of the trade war, the relationship became cold and sensitive.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Even before Trump took office in 2017, there were clues that the relationship would worsen. During Trump’s campaign, he vowed to rip up existing trade deals with China.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          “We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what we’re doing,” he said at a rally in Fort Wayne, Ind., before the election. “It's the greatest theft in the history of the world."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          He also said he was very not angry at China, instead, he was angry at the U.S. leaders: "I'm angry at our leaders, because they are grossly incompetent, and they shouldn't have ever been elected to do this job. Terrible."

          But Trump didn’t follow up right after he took office. In February 2017, Trump agreed with the One China policy, which insists that Taiwan is part of China. That April, China’s President Xi Jinping visited the U.S. During his meeting
          with
          Trump, the U.S. and China achieved a 10-part trade agreement leading the relationship hit “a new high,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross contended.</p>

          That March, the administration imposed tariffs on at least $50 million worth of Chinese goods, including clothing, shoes and electronics, indicating that Trump’s actual approach to China was what he said in his campaign: that China is

            “Trump is very opportunistic, and he basically started imposing tariffs,” said Gérard Roland, E. Morris Cox Professor of Economics and professor of political science at University of California, Berkeley. “But he hoped to have an
            agreement with China to kind of stop the trade war. I think that was probably his expectation.”

          In late 2018, after Vice President Mike Pence said the Trump admiration would prioritize tariffs on China’s goods to defeat “economic aggression” and would also defeat “growing Chinese military aggression,” the Chinese multinational
          technology giant Huawei became the next target in the trade conflict. In December 2018, Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, was arrested in Canada on a U.S. warrant charging her with Bank fraud, wire fraud, and
          conspiracies
          to
          commit bank and wire fraud.</p>
        <p class="paragraph" id="2018_2020">
          The relationships continued to deteriorate in 2019. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China fought back, increasing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. Meanwhile, the Trump
          administration banned foreign-made telecommunications equipment that it deemed likely to threaten national security. In addition, pro-democracy actions in Hong Kong since June 2019 have also harmed the vulnerable relationship. After
          Trump
          supported Hong Kong by signing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, China imposed sanctions on some U.S. companies news media and organizations with branches in China and suspended U.S. warships’ visits to Hong Kong.</p>

          In January 2020, the two-year trade war seemed to halt temporarily after the two countries signed “Phase One” of a trade deal. By buying an additional $200 billion American goods, mainly agriculture products and cars over two years,
          China
          had some tariffs removed.

            In the trade war, Chinese economy suffered a lot because the added tariffs hurt China’s position as a global manufacturing hub. American consumers are also victims in this war, as they have to pay higher price for the item that was
            cheaper before after putting more tariffs on costs.

            But the relationship between the world’s two largest economies didn’t have long to stabilize. One month later, coronavirus broke out in the U.S..

          After temporarily breaking up the trade war in January 2020, the U.S.-China relationship had a chance to be repaired. However, the relationship hasn’t had a chance to heal since the coronavirus outbreak in late January in Wuhan,

            “Coronavirus is only an excuse of worsening the relationship,” said Zhan, an economics professor at a Chinese university who spoke on condition of anonymity. “and the deterioration is reflected in multiple fields, including economy,

          The U.S.-China relationship was heading into its most strained year since 1979 and may even be escalating into another potential cold war in the 21st century. The pandemic is just a trigger; what has significantly worsened the
          relationship
          is the narrowed gap between the U.S. and China in economy and military power.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          In early February, the U.S. banned travelers from to stop the coronavirus from spreading, physically disconnecting from China.</p>

          Later that month, a “media war” between the U.S. and China began. After the U.S. State Department designated five Chinese media outlets as foreign missions. Later, China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters. Then the State
          Department required five Chinese state media outlets to limit the number of Chinese citizens working for them in the U.S..</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The conflicts swelled in March when President Trump first tweeted the words “Chinese virus.” The day after this tweet, China expelled American journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Pos and The Wall Street Journal.

          In April, Hong Kong came to the fore of the conflict. On April 18, Hong Kong police arrested 15 high-profile pro-democracy activists who had participated Hong Kong protests last year, a move condemned by the State Department. After
          China
          passed a new national security law for Hong Kong on June 30 aiming to end Hong Kong’s self-governance, the U.S. announced it would end exports of U.S.-made defense equipment to Hong Kong and impose the same restrictions on U.S.
          defense
          and dual-use technologies on Hong Kong as it does on China. In late May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement: “I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws

          the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997.” </p>
