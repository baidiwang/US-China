        <h1>From close cooperation to potential ‘cold war’:what happened to the U.S.-China relationship?</h1>
        </p>
        <p data-id="section_2">
          The U.S.-China relationship has been continually evolving since the two countries re-established diplomatic relations in 1979. At first their connections grew closer and closer in every aspect, including trade, politics and culture.
          However,
          the formerly good relationship has changed to the current tension, especially in the wake of President Trump’s trade war and the coronavirus outbreak.
        </p>
        <p data-id="section_3">
          “I think the relationship between the U.S. and China has really deteriorated,” said Gérard Roland, E. Morris Cox Professor of Economics and professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. “And it's probably not
          going
          to be healed anytime soon.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In such a complicated situation, where is the U.S.-China relationship heading?
        </p>


        <!-- headline> -->
        <p class="paragraph">
          The two countries’ relationship started deteriorating after Trump won the 2016 election as he underlined trade practices that he called unfair. In 2018, with the start of the trade war, the relationship became cold and sensitive.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          “He started a trade war because he was angry,” said Gérard Roland, E. Morris Cox Professor of Economics and professor of political science at University of California, Berkeley. “A really economic rationale is behind the trade war.”
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Even before Trump took office in 2017, there were clues that the relationship would worsen. During Trump’s campaign, he vowed to rip up existing trade deals with China.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          “We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what we’re doing,” he said at a rally in Fort Wayne, Ind., before the election.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          But Trump didn’t follow up right after he took office. In February 2017, Trump agreed with the One China policy, which insists that Taiwan is part of China. That April, China’s President Xi Jinping visited the U.S. During his meeting with
          Trump, the U.S. and China achieved a 10-part trade agreement leading the relationship hit “a new high,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross contended.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Even so, the trade war started in 2018.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          That March, the administration imposed tariffs on at least $50 million worth of Chinese goods, including clothing, shoes and electronics, indicating that Trump’s actual approach to China was what he said in his campaign: that China is an
          enemy of the U.S.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          “China is going to be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural products,” Trump announced after meeting Xi at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in June 2018, “and they're going to start that very soon, almost immediately."
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In late 2018, after Vice President Mike Pence said the Trump admiration would prioritize tariffs on China’s goods to defeat “economic aggression” and would also defeat “growing Chinese military aggression,” the Chinese multinational
          technology giant Huawei became the next target in the trade conflict. In December 2018, Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, was arrested in Canada on a U.S. warrant charging her with Bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracies to
          commit bank and wire fraud.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The relationships continued to deteriorate in 2019. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China fought back, increasing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. Meanwhile, the Trump
          administration banned foreign-made telecommunications equipment that it deemed likely to threaten national security. In addition, pro-democracy actions in Hong Kong since June 2019 have also harmed the vulnerable relationship. After Trump
          supported Hong Kong by signing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, China imposed sanctions on some U.S. companies news media and organizations with branches in China and suspended U.S. warships’ visits to Hong Kong.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          “Trump is very opportunistic, and he basically started imposing tariffs,” Roland said. “But he hoped to have an agreement with China to kind of stop the trade war. I think that was probably his expectation.”
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          In January 2020, the trade war seemed to halt temporarily after the two countries signed “Phase One” of a trade deal. By buying an additional $200 billion American goods, mainly agriculture products, China had some tariffs removed.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          But the relationship between the world’s two largest economies didn’t have long to stabilize. One month later, coronavirus broke out in the U.S..

    How was the relationship since Trump won the election until the coronavirus outbreak in March this year?
